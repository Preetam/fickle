Fickle [![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/PreetamJinka/fickle/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/PreetamJinka/fickle/latest)
======

A simple key-value store for fun!

It's called *fickle* for a reason! It changes frequently. I'm not an expert on database internals or protocols,
so I'm basically using my intuition to build this. If something doesn't seem to work, I change it. Eventually
I'll feel confident enough to use it for an actual project. Until then, I'm still tinkering.

**tl;dr:** Don't use this (yet!)
